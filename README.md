Galvanize Capstone Project: A Comprehensive Comic Book Recommendation Engine

For my final project, I built a comic book search and recommendation engine called Comix Nexus. I web scrapped the articles of top rated comic book from Wikipedia, preprocessed text with NLTK's tokenizer, and featurized the text with TF-IDF. Using cosine-similarity and Non-negative Matrix Factorization, I was able to perform recommendations from search query, comic-to-comic recommendation, and innovative recommendation that uses ranked latent topics inspired by FP Growth algorithm. To wrap it up, I made an interactive web app using Flask that you can run in your browser.

Enjoy!
